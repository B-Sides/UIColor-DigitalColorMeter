****** HOW TO USE ******

This is a simple UIColor category which adds a class level initializer that accepts the color strings output from the Digital Color Meter application in OS X. I regularly make iOS apps which refer to design PDF documents. Many times designers don't provide exact details to what colors are in the design. To get them I use the Digial Color Meter application located in 

Macintosh HD/Applications/Utilities/Digital Color Meter.app

Make sure the meter is set to show "RGB as percentage". With this done, get your cursor over the color you want and hit "Command + Shift + C". This will copy a string of the values to your clipboard. You can pass this string into the initializer and a UIColor object of that color will be returned. A simple example is provided in the sample application.
